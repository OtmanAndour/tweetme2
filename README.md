# tweetme2

A clone of the Twitter website, built with Django and React, to learn how to implement both React and Django in the same project, as well as learning more about those framework
and expand my coding skills.

This was done following the Youtube course "Create a Twitter-like App with Python Django JavaScript and React. Full TUTORIAL" By Justin Mitchel on the CodingEntrepreneurs channel.
Check out the tutorial in the link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1R_bykXHGE
